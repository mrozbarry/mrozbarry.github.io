          <p>
            Cardular is a modern way to play your favorite card games.  This is a free, no-bound-rules way to play cards with friends over the internet.  Games are persistent, and profiles are tied to your browser so you can come back to your game later.
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn't just about the standard 52 card deck; you can also create your own custom decks and use those!  Why not play <a href="https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/">Cards Against Humanity</a>, <a href="http://mtgjson.com/sets.html">Magic: The Gathering</a>, or <a href="http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/">Pok√©mon</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cardular will always be free to play, and free to host.  Cardular is built with free (or free-tiered) technologies, meaning if you want to host your own server, you can do it without spending a dime.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cardular uses the latest web technologies, so make sure you use a modern browser that supports HTML5.

          <h2>Available Sets</h2>
          <p>
            Sets are a way of expressing a set of card decks that are related.  For instance, to play Go Fish, you'd just need a single standard 52 card deck with Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades, each containing Ace through King, and optionally Jokers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sets are defined using a <code>set.json</code> file which describes the number of decks in a set, and some loose rules of how players should interact with them
          </p>
